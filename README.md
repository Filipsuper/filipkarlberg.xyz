The goal was to make a terminal-like website as I think the aesthetic is cool :P. I created a shortcut/fast travel for the people that have a hard time navigating the page which is a downside to this type of website as it makes it harder to navigate. The website is optimized for mobile view also so give that a try.

Built using react and tailwind.
